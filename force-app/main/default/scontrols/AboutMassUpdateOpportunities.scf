<h2>About Mass Edit Opportunities</h2>
<p>
This application is a simple web tab or custom link that will allow editing multiple opportunities at the same time. 
The result is the same as updating several opportunities but is acomplished much quicker and with fewer clicks.
<p>
The opportunities are presented in a grid with a pull down view list to control which opps are visible in the grid.
Once the list is selcted, you may edit the stage, amount, close date or forecast category.  
The columns of the grid are also sortable and there are links to navigate to the detail records for the accounts and 
opportunities that are present in the list.
<p>
When a row of data has been changed in the grid, it is colored so that you may see which rows have changes.  
When ready to make the update to the opportunities you simply click the "Save" button and your changes are sent to the database.

If you discover that your changes are not correct, you can discard all changes since the last save.  

Save early and often for best results!
