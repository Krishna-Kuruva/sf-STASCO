Hi {!Receiving_User.FirstName},

We recently received a request to reset your {!Community_Name} password. We can’t reset your password because your account is locked due to too many unsuccessful login attempts.

To unlock your account, contact Salesforce administrator

If you didn't request a password reset or haven’t tried to log in to your account recently, contact Salesforce administrator or reply to this email.

Thanks,
Shell Trading
